hashCode method of Object type is not overriden. Operations and mappings on hashmap
are done with hashCode method. So we have to override hashCode in addition to equals.
When we use hashmap, we have to override hashcode method of Object so that 
operations like containsKey(),containsValue() can use the overriden hashCode 
method instead of Object's hashCode method.
